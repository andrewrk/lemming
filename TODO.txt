Day 7:
 * belly flop glitch
 * create as many levels as possible exploring those concepts
 * don't call game over until the belly flop turns to dead body
 * download the final submission and play through it


Bugs:
 * look for spikes under all of the spots not just one
 * death shouldn't interupt the music flow
 * win sound sucks
 * bug: if you die several times, memory keeps expanding and sound stops (sometimes?)
 * handlers aren't cleared for monsters from level to level


After Competition:
 * animate the title screen

Brainstorming:
 * physics
   - freeze death
   - fire

 more ways to die:
    trap which kills you but helps the next guy
    a trap that will kill you but only once
    cannonball
