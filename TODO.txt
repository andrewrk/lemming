Day 7:
 * belly flop physics glitch
 * create as many levels as possible exploring those concepts
 * gory explosion of bloody organs when you die on spikes
 * critical bug: if you die several times, memory keeps expanding and sound stops
 * don't call game over until the belly flop turns to dead body
 * make sure it works on windows and mac
 * download the final submission and play through it


Bugs:
 * look for spikes under all of the spots not just one
 * death shouldn't interupt the music flow
 * win sound sucks


After Competition:
 * animate the title screen

Brainstorming:
 * physics
   - freeze death
   - fire
